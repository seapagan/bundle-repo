# Planned Improvements

- add more output formats - Text, Markdown, maybe others.
- output a summary of the file after generation.
- add a test suite to ensure the tool works as expected in a variety of
  scenarios.
- add a configuration file to store the token and other settings, will probably
  be a TOML file.
- allow the user to add extra file exclusions, or allow files that are excluded
  by default to be included.
- add the ability to check for updates and update the tool (or at least notify
  the user that an update is available and where to get).
- add the ability to specify the output file name.
- actually remove comments from the generated XML file. Perhaps add a flag to
  allow the user to choose whether to include comments or not.
