# BundleRepo <!-- omit in toc -->

**BundleRepo** is a beta tool designed to clone and pack a local or remote
(GitHub only for now) Git repository into a comprehensive XML file. The packed
XML includes detailed metadata about each file, such as the size in bytes and
the number of lines, making it suitable for large language model (LLM)
consumption, code analysis, and repository review.

XML was chosen for the file output format since it is very well structured and
LLM models can easily parse it (better than a plain-text dump).

It is inspired by [Repomix](#acknowledgements) which is a great tool, but is
written in TypeScript and needs a Node.js environment to run. Eventually this
project will produce binaries and not need Rust installed to run.

The generated XML metadata and structure are inspired by the output of Repomix
(a lot of the header text was taken from there), with enhancements that include
additional file attributes, instructions for the LLM and a more robust
structure. At this time `xml` output is the only supported output format,
however future versions may include additional formats.

XML was chosen as the default output format since it is very well structured
and LLM models can easily parse it (better than a plain-text dump - see this
[link][why-xml] from Anthropic as to why XML is a superior format for feeding
context and instructions into an LLM).

## Compatibility

The tool is designed and tested to work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (Windows 10
and 11 tested).

## Features

- **Clone Git Repositories**: Supports cloning both public and private
  repositories (with token support). Only supports `https` URLs at this time.
- **File Scanning**: Automatically scans the repository and adds all files to
  the output, excluding standard ignored files (e.g. `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`,
  etc).

  Any file listed in a `.gitignore` file will be excluded from the output and
  metadata.

  **Binary file content will always be excluded**, though they will be listed in
  the `<repository_structure>` node and a `<file>` node will be created in the
  XML to show that the file was excluded and why.

  See [Ignored Files](#ignored-files) for a full list of excluded files.

- **Metadata Extraction**: For each file, the XML output includes:
  - `path`: the file path relative to the repository root
  - `size`: file size in bytes
  - `lines`: number of lines in the file
  - Raw file content (not escaped)
- **Token Count**: Calculates the number of tokens in the final XML file, based
  on the specified model (default is GPT-4o). Only OpenAI models are supported
  at this time, though I may add support for others in the future.
- **XML Output**: Generates an XML file (`packed-repo.xml`) that contains the
  entire repository structure and file details.
- **Global and local configuration files**: Allows you to set default values
  globally and override them on a per-project basis. All settings can be further
  overridden by command line options.

This tool is currently under active development, and more features will be
implemented quickly. Please **star** this repository to stay updated on new
releases and features.

## Usage

This will be available as a binary download in the future, but for now, you can
build it from source or install from `crates.io`. You will need to have
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system to
build the project.

### Installation

Clone the project and install dependencies.

- From [crates.io][crates-io-page]:

  ```bash
  cargo install bundle_repo
  ```

  The DeepSeek tokenizer file is embedded in the binary, so no additional setup is required.

- From source:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/seapagan/bundle-repo.git
  cd bundle-repo
  cargo build --release
  ```

  Move the binary to a directory in your `PATH`:

  eg for Linux or MacOS:

  ```bash
  sudo mv ./target/release/bundlerepo /usr/local/bin
  ```

### Running the Tool

Use the GitHub short form:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name
```

Use the full URL:

```bash
bundlerepo https://github.com/user_name/repo_name
```

Or use the current directory (if it is a git repository):

```bash
bundlerepo
```

Only the **`https`** protocol is supported at this time. The tool will not yet
work with **`ssh`** URLs (ie **not** `git@github.com:seapagan/bundle-repo.git`)

The tool will actually bundle **any** files in the current directory (unless
they are in the hard-coded ignore list). This can probably be useful for
bundling any related files that you wish to feed to an AI. However, you may need
to edit the `<purpose>` and `<instructions>` nodes in the output XML. I may add
a flag to make this easier in the future (`--not-code` or something).

However, it still needs to be an actual git repository or the code will exit. I
may add a flag to allow non-git repositories in the future.

#### Specify the branch for a remote Git repository

If you want to specify a branch for a remote repository you can do so using the
`--branch` or `-b` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --branch my_branch
```

Without this flag, the default branch will be used, which is usually `main` or
`master`.

The `--branch` option only works for **remote repositories**. It has no effect
when bundling a local repository. If you want to bundle a local repository with
a specific branch you will need to check out that branch before running the
tool.

### Output

#### Output to File

This is the default operation of the tool, the XML output will be written to
`packed-repo.xml`, which contains the hierarchical structure and metadata of the
repository files. This can then be passed to an LLM model for analysis (for
example, attach the output file to a ChatGPT or Claude prompt).

The filename can be changed using the `--file` or `-f` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --file my-repo.xml
```

The output file will be written to the current directory unless a path is
specified:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --file /path/to/output.xml
```

#### Output to stdout

You can output the XML to the terminal by using the `--stdout` or `-s` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --stdout
```

This will print the XML output to the terminal, which can then be redirected to
a file or piped to another application.

In this case, the `--file` flag is ignored and no file is written to disk.

#### Copy to Clipboard

You can copy the XML output to the clipboard by using the `--clipboard` or `-c`
flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --clipboard
```

This will copy the XML output to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into
another application or file, or indeed directly into an LLM prompt. Note that it
is likely to be a large amount of text, so ensure your clipboard can handle it.

In this case, the `--file` flag is ignored and no file is written to disk.

#### Add line numbers

If you want to add line numbers to the output, you can use the `--lnumbers` or
`-l` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --lnumbers
```

This will add line numbers physically to each line in the output, which can be
useful for debugging or analysis. Note that this will increase the token count
of the output, so be aware of that when using it. Extra info for the LLM will be
added to the `<instructions>` node to explain the line numbers.

### Choose Model for Token Count

After generating the xml file, the tool gives a count of the number of tokens in
the file, to give you an idea of context usage and costs. By default it
calculates the number of tokens for the GPT-4o model, but you can specify
another model using the `--model` or `-m` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --model gpt3.5
```

Valid models are `gpt4o`, `gpt4`, `gpt3.5`, `gpt3`, `gpt2` and `deepseek`. It is important
to use the correct model, as the token count is vastly different between the 3
and 4 series models.

The tool supports both OpenAI models (using the `tiktoken` library) and the DeepSeek model.
For OpenAI models, the count returned by this tool is identical to that returned by
their [web app](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).

For the DeepSeek model, the tool uses the official DeepSeek tokenizer specs
from [here](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/token_usage) to ensure accurate
token counts.

Claude models are not currently supported as Anthropic has not released their tokenizer
specifications. Support may be added in the future if they release a public tokenizer.

### GitHub Token

For **private repositories**, or to bypass usage restrictions, you can provide a
GitHub token to access the repository. You can create a token by following the
instructions
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Once you have the token, you can pass it to the tool using the `--token` flag:

```bash
bundlerepo user_name/repo_name --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**Passing a token is totally optional if you are only using public
repositories.**

## Command Line Options

The full list of command line options can be seen by running with the `--help`
flag:

```pre
Pack a local or remote Git Repository to XML for LLM Consumption.

Usage: bundlerepo [OPTIONS] [REPO]

Arguments:
  [REPO]  GitHub repository to clone (e.g. 'user/repo' or full GitHub URL). If not provided, the current directory will be searched for a Git repository.

Options:
  -b, --branch <BRANCH>     Specify a branch to checkout for remote repositories
  -f, --file <OUTPUT_FILE>  Filename to save the bundle as. [default: packed-repo.xml]
  -s, --stdout              Output the XML directly to stdout without creating a file.
  -m, --model <MODEL>       Model to use for tokenization. Supported models: 'gpt4o', 'gpt4', 'gpt3.5', 'gpt3', 'gpt2' [default: gpt4o]

  -V, --version             Print version information and exit
  -h, --help                Print help
```

## Configuration File

The tool supports two configuration files:

- Global config at `~/.config/bundlerepo/config.toml`
- Local config at `.bundlerepo.toml` in your current directory

This allows you to set default values globally and override them on a
per-project basis. All settings can be further overridden by command line
options.

The configuration files use TOML format. Here's an example configuration:

```toml
# ~/.config/bundlerepo/config.toml or .bundlerepo.toml
output_file = "my-default-output.xml"
model = "gpt3.5"
stdout = false
clipboard = false
line_numbers = true
token = "your-github-token"
extend_exclude = ["*.md", "*.txt", "docs/*"]  # Additional patterns to exclude
exclude = ["*.exe", "*.dll", "node_modules/*"]  # File patterns to exclude
utf8 = true  # Force UTF-8 encoding for all text files
```

All settings are optional. Settings are applied in the following order of
precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Command line options
2. Local config file (`.bundlerepo.toml`)
3. Global config file (`~/.config/bundlerepo/config.toml`)
4. Built-in defaults

Available configuration options:

- `output_file`: Default output filename (default: "packed-repo.xml")
- `model`: Default model for token counting (default: "gpt4o")
- `stdout`: Whether to output to stdout by default (default: false)
- `clipboard`: Whether to copy to clipboard by default (default: false)
- `line_numbers`: Whether to add line numbers by default (default: false)
- `token`: Your GitHub personal access token (default: none)
- `extend_exclude`: Additional file patterns to exclude (default: none)
- `exclude`: File patterns to exclude, replacing the default ignore list
  (default: none)
- `utf8`: Whether to force UTF-8 encoding for all text files (default: false)

The `extend_exclude` and `exclude` options can be specified either by using
multiple `-e` or `-x` flags on the command line:

```bash
bundlerepo user/repo -e "*.md" -e "*.txt" -e "docs/*"
bundlerepo user/repo -x "*.exe" -x "*.dll" -x "node_modules/*"
```

Or as arrays in the TOML configuration file:

```toml
extend_exclude = ["*.md", "*.txt", "docs/*"]
exclude = ["*.exe", "*.dll", "node_modules/*"]
```

The `extend_exclude` patterns will be **added** to the default ignore list,
while the `exclude` patterns will **replace** the default ignore list entirely.

**Important**: When the `exclude` option is used (either via command line or
config file), both the default ignore list and any `extend_exclude` patterns are
completely ignored. The `exclude` patterns become the only ignore rules in
effect **EXCEPT that in either case, files in the `.gitignore` are ALWAYS
ignored.**

**Note**: The `extend_exclude` option is useful for excluding additional files
that aren't in the default ignore list but that you don't want to include in
your XML output. The `exclude` option gives you complete control over what files
are ignored, replacing the built-in ignore list. Both options can help reduce
token usage and remove irrelevant files from the LLM context.

Storing your GitHub token in the configuration file can be more convenient than
passing it via command line, especially if you frequently work with private
repositories. Just be sure to keep your configuration file secure.

The UTF-8 encoding feature (`--utf8` flag or `utf8 = true` in config) ensures all text files
are encoded in UTF-8 before being included in the XML output. This is useful when working
with files that may use different encodings, ensuring compatibility with LLMs and other tools.
You can disable this with `--no-utf8` even if it's enabled in the config file.

## Ignored Files

The tool will ignore the following files by default and (except for binary, see
below) they will not be listed anywhere in the XML output:

- **ANY Binary File**. If you have a binary file in your repository, it will be
  listed in the XML output, but the content will be excluded.
- `.gitignore`
- any file **listed** in a `.gitignore` file
- `.git` folder and it's contents
- `.github` folder and it's contents
- Python requirements files (`requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, etc)
- Lockfiles - any file ending in `.lock`
- `renovate.json`
- `license` files (e.g. `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, etc). Also matches the
  alternate 'Licence' spelling.
- `.vscode` folder and it's contents

This list is hard-coded (and to be honest is tuned to my current workflow)
however it can be added to / replaced by the `extend_exclude` and `exclude`
options above.

I'm very open to adding other files that should be ignored by default, If you
have a suggestion, please open a PR or an Issue on GitHub. For example, tool
configuration files (eslintrc, prettierrc, etc), which are not needed by an LLM
and just take up token space.

If there is demand, I may add a flag to allow the user to bypass this list and
include all files. However, binary files will always be excluded as they don't
fit well in XML.

## Planned Improvements

You can find planned improvements and known issues etc in the [TODO.md](TODO.md)
file.

## XML Layout

The generated `packed-repo.xml` follows a structured format that can be easily
understood by an LLM. Below is an example layout with explanations for each tag:

```xml
<repository>
  <file_summary>
    <!-- Metadata describing the purpose and file structure of the packed repository -->
    <!-- It also contains some instructions to help the LLM properly decode and understand the data -->
  </file_summary>

  <repository_structure>
    <summary>
      <!-- A brief summary of the folder structure in the repository -->
    </summary>
    <folder name="src">
      <!-- Folders contain nested folders and files -->
      <file path="main.rs">
        <!-- Files are listed by path relative to the repository root -->
      </file>
    </folder>
  </repository_structure>

  <repository_files>
    <summary>
      <!-- A summary of the files and their contents -->
    </summary>
    <file path="src/main.rs" size="1474" lines="53">
      <!-- For each file, the path, size in bytes, and number of lines are provided -->
      <!-- Full file contents are included here -->
    </file>
  </repository_files>
</repository>
```

## Beta Status

This tool is currently in **beta**. While the core functionality works, there
may be edge cases or features yet to be fully refined. Feedback and
contributions are welcome to improve and stabilize the tool.

There is a pressing need to improve the test suite to ensure the tool works as
expected in a variety of scenarios. This is a priority for the next release.

## Acknowledgements

**Bundle Repo** is a rewrite from scratch of the original [Repomix (formerly
'repopack)](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) project, though none of the
source code was used or even looked at (the output file header however was
heavily borrowed from). The idea was to create a similar tool from scratch, with
a few enhancements and improvements. It's also part of my journey to learn Rust
and build useful tools for all.
